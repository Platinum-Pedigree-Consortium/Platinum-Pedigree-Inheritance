# SV merging

## VCF normalization

Prior to SV merging it is important to handle the differences of SV callers by normalizing the VCF files. Most notably this includes dropping INFO/FORMAT fields that are not shared across different callers, reformatting fields, and prefixing SV caller id to variant IDs. This can be done using `strip_vcf.py`, given an input json file containing VCF file paths (*.pedfilt.vcf files), their caller identity and (optional) prefix to add to each variant ID (see `strip_vcf.json` for an example):

```
{
"caller": "sawfish",
"path": "/.../sawfish.pedfilt.vcf",
"prefix_tag": "sawfish"
}
```
and an output path. Which will write a normalized VCF file (*.strip.pedfilt.vcf) for each input. Supported SV callers: sawfish, sniffles, pav, pggb, pbsv, dipcall.

```
python strip_vcf.py -i strip_vcf.json -o ../sv_vcfs/out/
```

The optional parameter `--infer_svinfo` can be added which will try to infer missing SV information from the variant (this will check the header of the input VCF to see if SVTYPE/SVLEN are defined). This currently only supports insertions (INS) and deletions (DEL), anything else is marked as OTHER.

## VCF merging

After normalization the VCF files can be merged using `interval_tree_merge.py` given the space separated paths of normalized VCFs which also determines the merging ordering and a output file. Optional CLI options: `--flank_len` (default = 200), allows for setting the size of flanks when building intervals, `--diff_threshold` (default = 50), allows for setting the threshold for length difference when finding best matches, `--allow_same_source_merge`, allows variants to give support to primary variants from the same source (disabled by default).

Note: Make sure that the ID field of each variant in the normalized VCF follows the format: PREFIX_CALLER

The below command (assuming each SV VCF file is present), first merge pbsv into sawfish, then sniffles in that result, and finally do the same with PAV.

```
python interval_tree_merge.py --vcf_files ../sv_vcfs/out/sawfish.vcf ../sv_vcfs/out/pbsv.vcf ../sv_vcfs/out/sniffles.vcf ../sv_vcfs/out/pav.vcf -o merged.vcf 
```

## VCF intersection (Ebert)

To identify the intersection and mutually exclusive SVs between our merged call set and the Ebert call set, the `sv_intersect_ebert.py` script can be used. The script has two main inputs: `--base-vcf`, which specifies our base call set, and `--query-vcf`, which specifies the Ebert call set. Optional CLI options: `--flank_len` (default = 200), allows for setting the size of flanks when building intervals, `--sizesim-threshold` (default = 0.7), specifies the relative size difference allowed before two SVs are no longer considered equivalent.

Example usage:
```
python sv_intersect_ebert.py --base-vcf NA12878.merged_hg38.svs.sort.vcf.gz --query-vcf NA12878.freeze4.sv.alt.vcf.gz --sizesim-threshold 0.7 --flank-len 200
```
